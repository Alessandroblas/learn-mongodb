MongoDB - "We love it!"

This repo has evolved into a dumping ground for all kinds of MongoDB tidbit's.

**_Warning!_** not everything here is complete and no guarantees.

Sorry for this, but unfortunately the earth keeps spinning around the sun and causing my
calendar to move to the next fully booked day. (I am very happy our planet continues this spinning.)
